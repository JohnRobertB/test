     <h1>NetBoss Technologies, Inc. - Network Management and Service Assurance</h1>
    <section class="section-intro">
    <p>Truly optimizing your Service Assurance function is a journey, one that can be significantly more productive with a Trusted Advisor. At NTI we understand that Service Assurance is a means to an end. That end although unique for each corporation is focused around customer experience and satisfaction with the services they receive. This sounds simple but a few corporate strategies turn into many operational goals. Those goals require even more tactical plans that need more staff to deliver the resulting tactics. NTI has deep experience working with service operations and NOCs to assure that your cascading Service Assurance processes and tactics are optimized to serve your corporate strategic business goals.</p>
    <p>Not every Carrier Service Provider will have the same strategic goals.  As such they should not have the same Service Assurance Program. That’s why NTI Business Optimization utilizes DATA to maximize your Service Assurance program.</p>
    <p>When we finish our Service Assurance solution implementation, you can clearly articulate what Service Assurances means to the business and measure how it is achieved throughout each of your organizations.</p>

    <section class="section-service-assurance">
  <h2>Service Assurance Solutions and Consultancy</h2>
  <p>The NTI Service Assurance program team works with you to ensure your Service Assurance function is optimized and operating in a manner that best contributes to a positive end-user/customer experience. Why is that important?  Revenue, the lifeblood of a Service Provider’s business, comes from engaged customers who utilize and want new features. So, it is likely that your corporate strategy focuses on some key customer value propositions. Everything else should be a means to that end.</p>
  
  <h3>NetBoss Talent and Experience</h3>
  <p>NetBoss has the talent and experience that understands the key to delivering world-class network operations is the alignment of your strategy and Service Assurance function. We apply over two decades of in-depth NOC product and implementation experience to our comprehensive set of offerings carefully coordinated to meet your specific needs.</p>

  <h3>Four Distinct Services</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Defining and measuring Service Assurance</li>
    <li>Strategizing to achieve Service Assurance Mapping and Alignment</li>
    <li>Re-aligning to Transform processes to achieve goals</li>

    <section class="section-strategizing">
  <h2>Strategizing to achieve Service Assurance Mapping and Alignment</h2>
  <p>NTI brings “fresh eyes” to your organization. If you have ever wondered whether or not the management of your Service Assurance function and customer experience is truly serving your strategic goals, NTI can provide the answer by reviewing your:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Strategic Directives: These corporate directives are typically longer term, cross-functional strategies, e.g., “Increase Market Penetration.”</li>
    <li>Operational Goals: These management goals are typically measured quarterly, across process boundaries, and have single management ownership, e.g., “Market Price Leadership.”</li>
    <li>Tactical Objectives: These organizational goals are typically measured monthly and owned by the department, e.g., “Undercut Market Price by 10%.”</li>
    <li>Tactical Tasks: These departmental tasks are typically measured daily, e.g., “Reduce MTTR and cost by 15%.”</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>A small number of corporate strategic directives launch many tactical objectives and tasks. This usually results in gaps between the strategic and tactical objectives that minimize their effectiveness. By leveraging NTI’s formal and informal deep-dive approach you can identify and measure if you are truly leveraging your Service Assurance tools and resources in a manner that serves your strategic direction. Whether you plan to offer the best ISP experience or the lowest fault repair times, NTI will investigate whether your Service Assurance processes and individual resource objectives are aligned.</p>
